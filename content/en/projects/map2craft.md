A Python-based toolset for generating realistic Minecraft worlds from real-world geospatial data. This project uses SCons to orchestrate the processing of elevation data, bathymetry, proper land cover mapping, and OpenStreetMap (OSM) features into a WorldPainter-compatible format.

## Features

### 🌍 Real-world Terrain & Bathymetry
Downloads and processes high-resolution elevation data (SRTM/Copernicus) and reprojects it to meters (EPSG:3857).
*   **Bathymetry Merging**: Seamlessly blends land elevation with underwater depth data (EMODnet/GEBCO) to create realistic coastlines and ocean floors.
*   **Zero-Level Handling**: Configurable sea level and masking to prevent shallow coastal artifacts.

### 🌲 Biomes & Land Cover
Uses **ESA WorldCover** data to automatically map real-world land categories to Minecraft biomes.
*   **Smart Mapping**: Forests, shrublands, grasslands, and bare areas are translated into appropriate biome IDs.
*   **Cliff Detection**: Slope-based analysis automatically assigns cliff or stone shore biomes to steep terrain.

### 🛣️ OpenStreetMap Integration
Fetches vector data from OSM to populate the world with human infrastructure.
*   **Roads**: Carves road networks (motorways to residential) directly into the terrain with configurable widths.
*   **Buildings**: Places building footprints. Supports both procedural block placement and **custom schematic** usage (e.g., cathedrals, mills, towers) defined in `config.yaml`.
*   **Waterways**: Rivers and streams are carved into the land, ensuring hydrologically consistent water features.

### 🎨 WorldPainter Automation
Generates a comprehensive `build_world.js` script that orchestrates the entire map creation process in WorldPainter.
*   **Layer Handling**: Automates the application of heightmaps, biome masks, and annotation layers.
*   **Export Ready**: Produces a `.world` file ready for export to Minecraft.

### 🖼️ Visualization Support
Includes a dedicated preview pipeline (`scons preview`) to generate debug images for:
*   **Heightmap**: `assets/img/heightmap.png`
*   **Terrain**: `assets/img/terrain.png`
*   **Land Cover**: `assets/img/land_cover.png`
*   **Biomes**: `assets/img/biomes.png`
*   **Schematics**: `assets/img/artifacts.png`


## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.10+**
*   **WorldPainter**: Installed and accessible from system's path.
*   **SCons**: For build automation.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: You may need `gdal` installed on your system for `rasterio` and `osgeo` dependencies depending on your OS.*

## Configuration

Create a `.yaml` in the `config/` folder to customize your project:

*   **Project**: Set name and directory paths.
*   **Geospatial**: Define `bounds` (min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat) and `resolution`.
*   **Minecraft**: Configure build limits, sea level, and scale.
*   **Features**: Enable/disable biomes, roads, buildings, waterways, etc.

## Usage

This project uses **SCons** to manage the build pipeline. All commands are run from the project root.

### Standard Build
To run the full pipeline, generate the world, and install it to your Minecraft saves folder:

```bash
scons
```
*(This runs the default `install` target)*

### specific Targets

You can run specific parts of the pipeline:

*   **Generate Previews**:
    ```bash
    scons preview
    ```
    Creates preview images in `build/[project_name]/preview/` (`terrain.png`, `biome.png`, etc.).

*   **Process Elevation Only**:
    ```bash
    scons process
    ```

*   **Download & Process OSM Data**:
    ```bash
    scons roads buildings waterways
    ```

*   **Generate WorldPainter World**:
    ```bash
    scons world
    ```
    Creates the `.world` file in `output/` using the generated script.

*   **Export Level**:
    ```bash
    scons export
    ```
    Converts the `.world` file to a Minecraft save directory structure in `output/worlds/`.

## Project Structure

*   `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., `default.yaml`).
*   `SConstruct`: SCons build definition file.
*   `src/`: Source code modules.
    *   `data.py`: Elevation and bathymetry downloading.
    *   `geospatial.py`: Terrain processing, scaling, and reprojection.
    *   `biomes.py`: Biome mapping and classification.
    *   `osm.py`, `roads.py`, `buildings.py`, `waterways.py`: OSM data integration.
    *   `worldpainter.py`: Automation script generation.
    *   `visualize.py`: Preview image generation logic.
    *   `amulet_editor.py`: Final world placement and processing.
*   `build/`: Generated artifacts, downloaded raw data, and intermediate masks (organized by project name).
*   `assets/`: Static assets like `schematics/` for building placement.
